If you want FACEBOOK like functionality for your buddypress installation where Homepage for Vistiors is different than Logged in users, you should try this plugin. This plugin performs following tasks:

** when user log into your website, user is redirected to his/her profile.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. How this plugin can be helpful?
Ans: It is suggested that you should have a static HOMEPAGE for your visitors which is having register link. Now once, your user has logged into buddypress, he will be redirected to his/her profile. So, you dont need seperate plugin which redirects the user to profile on logging in. Secondly everytime user clicks on homepage links or logo of your website, he will be redirected to his/her profile which makes easy accessiblity of own profile to the user and more over there is no need to show register link to logged in user.
